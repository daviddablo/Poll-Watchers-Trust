Replication code for my senior thesis on race, partisanship, and poll watchers

## Abstract
Poll watchers, also called election observers or monitors, have grown in salience and polarization in recent elections. Given that one ostensible purpose of poll watchers is to increase voter confidence in the integrity of elections, studying to what extent this is the case is vital. While previous scholarship has found poll watchers can boost the legitimacy of elections by providing the perception of unbiased and bipartisan observers, little is known about how racial dynamics might complicate this relationship. In this paper, I ask: How do the racial and partisan identities of poll watchers affect voter confidence in the election? How might the alignment of a co-racial or a co-partisan poll watcher increase voter confidence in the election? To test this, this paper leverages a conjoint survey experiment fielded after the November 2024 Presidential Election. I find that voters are most trusting of polling locations that are observed by nonpartisan and co-partisan poll watchers, as well as locations observed by poll watchers that align with the voter's ethnoracial background. I also present original observational data on the location, prevalence, and perceptions of poll watchers—which helps create a comprehensive overview of these observers.
